# Open-Source Hybrid Data Sharing & AI Research Platform Architecture

## Introduction

This document presents an open-source architectural blueprint for a hybrid data-sharing and AI research platform tailored to supply chain and supply chain finance research. The design emphasizes scientific reproducibility, scalability, and ease of collaboration across academia and industry. All components in the stack are open source, aligning with best practices that recommend using free/open software to make research easier to reproduce and share. The platform can be deployed on-premises (for data privacy and control) with optional cloud integration for scalability. It supports access via web browsers and native tools on laptops, enabling users ranging from students and academics to industry partners to participate. The following sections detail the architecture’s layers and components, and justify each choice in terms of openness, reproducibility, scalability, and usability.

&#x20;*High-level architecture of the hybrid data-sharing and AI research platform. On-premises servers (blue dashed box) run core services (Nextcloud, JupyterHub, workflow engine, data catalog, etc.) on a Kubernetes cluster backed by Ceph storage. Users access the platform via web interfaces (Nextcloud for file sharing, Jupyter notebooks, dashboards) or sync clients. Data ingestion pipelines bring external data into the storage layer, which is cataloged for discovery. Optional cloud extensions (orange dashed box) can provide additional compute nodes or storage, and an API gateway enables programmatic access to data and models.*

## 1. Core Infrastructure Stack (OS, Containers, Orchestration, Storage)

* **Operating System – DAT Linux:** All server nodes run DAT Linux, an Ubuntu LTS-based distribution optimized for data science. DAT Linux comes with dozens of open-source data science tools pre-installed and a unified control panel, providing a ready-to-use environment for researchers. This saves users from individually installing libraries and ensures a consistent base across the platform. Using a common data-science-focused OS improves ease of use (especially for students) and reproducibility, since every node has identical libraries and configurations. Being Linux-based and open source, DAT Linux also allows deep customization and scriptable provisioning.

* **Containerization & Orchestration:** All services and computational workloads are containerized (using Docker or Podman), which encapsulates their dependencies for consistent execution. A Kubernetes cluster manages these containers across the on-premises servers, providing scheduling, load-balancing, and failover. Kubernetes was chosen for its robust self-healing and scaling capabilities and because it supports hybrid deployments (on-prem and cloud) out-of-the-box. With Kubernetes, the platform can automatically recover from node failures and can scale out by adding nodes (including cloud VM nodes for burst workloads) without disrupting users. Kubernetes is an open standard in cloud-native infrastructure, ensuring no vendor lock-in and a large community for support. All container images used are open source, and Kubernetes itself is open source, aligning with our reproducibility goals.

* **Storage Layer – Nextcloud with Distributed Storage:** The core storage and collaboration service is **Nextcloud**, deployed as a containerized service on the Kubernetes cluster. Nextcloud is an open-source file sync and share platform that serves as the primary data repository and sharing interface. It is highly trusted and widely adopted (with over 400,000 deployments) as the leading on-premises content collaboration platform. Nextcloud provides a web UI and WebDAV/Sync clients for users to upload, download, and organize large datasets, documents, and analysis results. Underneath Nextcloud, the system uses a scalable **Ceph** storage cluster (or similar distributed file/object store) to handle large volumes of data reliably. Ceph is open source and provides redundant, distributed storage (with an S3-compatible object interface that Nextcloud can leverage), ensuring that even multi-terabyte supply chain datasets or big model files can be stored and accessed efficiently. Using Nextcloud on Ceph combines user-friendly file access with enterprise-grade storage scalability. All stored data can optionally be mirrored or backed up to cloud object storage for disaster recovery, keeping the deployment hybrid-ready. Nextcloud’s use of standard protocols and Ceph’s open design mean the data layer is fully under the researchers’ control with no proprietary formats. The choice of Nextcloud also brings a thriving community and plugins ecosystem, and its open-source nature avoids any licensing barriers or lock-in.

* **Networking & Compute Infrastructure:** The on-premises servers (running DAT Linux) form a secure network where Kubernetes orchestrates service pods and maybe an internal software-defined network. Typical supporting infrastructure includes an open-source database (e.g. MariaDB/PostgreSQL) for Nextcloud’s metadata and user info, and Redis for caching, both of which run as highly-available clustered containers on Kubernetes. The compute nodes can include GPU-equipped machines (see AI/ML layer) and are interconnected with high-speed links to facilitate fast data access from the Ceph storage. All management of servers (setup, configuration) can be automated with tools like Ansible (also open source), which the architecture supports to enable reproducible infrastructure provisioning (Infrastructure-as-Code).

**Justification:** This core stack ensures a solid foundation: a consistent OS with pre-loaded tools accelerates onboarding and reduces setup errors, containerization guarantees environment consistency across services and experiments, and Kubernetes + Ceph deliver scalability and reliability (critical as data grows or usage expands). All components (Linux, Docker, K8s, Nextcloud, Ceph) are open source, which not only eliminates license costs but also improves transparency and reproducibility. Anyone can deploy the same stack elsewhere to reproduce results, and community-driven improvements can be adopted readily. The use of popular open projects also means support and integration with other tools (e.g., Nextcloud’s compatibility with various authentication methods or K8s operators for components) is readily available.

## 2. Data Handling (Ingestion, Cataloging, Metadata Tagging, Versioning)

* **Data Ingestion Pipelines:** To ingest and integrate data from multiple sources (e.g. company ERP databases, IoT sensor feeds, public datasets, or partner APIs), the platform uses open-source ETL tools such as **Apache NiFi**. NiFi provides a web-based interface to create data flow pipelines, with a wide range of connectors and processors for extracting, transforming, and loading data. For example, a NiFi flow could pull supply chain transaction records from an FTP server or API, sanitize and standardize the data, then drop it into Nextcloud’s storage (or directly into the Ceph backend). NiFi’s provenance tracking and versioning of flows also contribute to reproducibility – it can record exactly which data was ingested when and how. Alternative or supplementary ingestion tools like **Airbyte** or **Talend** (also open source) could be used similarly, but NiFi is highlighted for its robustness and real-time stream capabilities. These ingestion pipelines run on the same Kubernetes infrastructure (as pods) or on dedicated ingestion nodes, and they can be scheduled or triggered by events (e.g., new data arrival). By using open-source ETL, the platform ensures flexibility in connecting to diverse data sources and the ability for technical users to extend connectors as needed. All data entering the system is thus handled in a controlled, automated way, ensuring raw data is faithfully captured and ready for analysis.

* **Data Catalog & Metadata Management:** As datasets accumulate, a **data catalog** service indexes and organizes them. The architecture includes an open-source metadata catalog such as **Apache Atlas** or **Amundsen** to manage dataset metadata, track lineage, and assist discovery. Every dataset ingested or uploaded can be registered in the catalog with descriptive metadata (title, description, source, owner), keywords, and tags (e.g., “supply\_chain”, “2025 Q1 finance data”), and importantly any *data licensing or usage restrictions*. Atlas/Amundsen can also record data lineage – for example, if one dataset is derived from another through a cleaning script, this relationship is captured. This is vital for both academic reproducibility and data governance: researchers and industry partners can understand where a given data came from and how it has been processed. The catalog system provides a search interface so users can find data relevant to their research without combing through raw files. It also acts as a governance tool, allowing administrators to classify data sensitivity (public, confidential, etc.) and ensure compliance with any data-sharing agreements or licenses. Being open source, these catalog tools can be integrated tightly with the platform (for instance, automated updates from NiFi when new data arrives, and authentication integration with the platform’s SSO). The result is a living inventory of data assets that all authorized users can browse, promoting data reuse and transparency.

* **Metadata Tagging & Annotation:** Beyond the formal catalog, the platform leverages Nextcloud’s file tagging and commenting features for lightweight metadata. Users can tag files or folders in Nextcloud with project names, experiment IDs, or confidentiality labels. Nextcloud’s tags and comments are stored in its database and can be indexed or synced to the main data catalog to unify metadata. For example, a researcher might tag a dataset as “draft” or “verified” to indicate its quality status, or add a note about assumptions in the data. This encourages collaborative curation of data. All such metadata is open and accessible via Nextcloud’s API for further analysis or export if needed.

* **Data Versioning:** To ensure full reproducibility of analyses, the platform incorporates dataset version control. Large datasets are managed with tools like **Data Version Control (DVC)**, which is an open-source system for tracking versions of data files and machine learning models in tandem with code. Researchers can use DVC in their projects to snapshot a particular state of input data (DVC will store hashes of files and can save file versions to the Ceph storage or an object storage remote). This way, if a model or analysis is re-run in the future, the exact data version used originally can be retrieved. DVC essentially brings Git-like version tracking to large data files without storing them in Git itself. It also handles pipelines: transformations of data (like cleaning scripts or feature generation) can be captured in DVC pipeline files, so the exact sequence of steps and intermediate results are recorded. This practice, combined with the data catalog lineage, means any result in the platform can be traced back to specific input data versions and process steps – a cornerstone of scientific reproducibility. In addition to DVC, Nextcloud itself provides file versioning at a basic level (it keeps previous file revisions on upload), which can serve as a simple safety net for user-managed versioning. However, for rigorous research needs, DVC or similar is recommended for explicit version tracking and tying versions to code commits. All data and metadata versions are stored on the platform’s open infrastructure, so they can be exported or inspected without proprietary tools. Moreover, using open formats (CSV, Parquet, etc.) for data ensures that versioned datasets remain accessible in the long term.

**Justification:** This data handling layer ensures that data entering the platform is systematically managed and documented. Supply chain research often involves heterogeneous data (financial records, sensor logs, etc.), so flexible ingestion (NiFi) is key to accommodate various formats and update frequencies. The metadata catalog addresses the complexity by providing a clear view of what data exists and how it’s been used, which is crucial for both collaboration and compliance. Researchers and industry partners can trust the data because its origin and transformations are recorded (lineage), and they can quickly find relevant datasets via search instead of tribal knowledge. Version control of data guarantees that analyses can be repeated exactly – if someone re-runs an analysis next year, they can pull the exact 2025-Q1 dataset version that was used originally, for example. All these components are open source, meaning we can customize them (e.g., add custom metadata fields for “Data License”) and they integrate well (NiFi and Atlas both have robust APIs). The openness also means if the research group wants to publish metadata or share certain data publicly, they could integrate with open data portals or easily export the catalog, ensuring no data is trapped in a closed system. Ultimately, this layer provides **data fidelity** (through careful ingestion), **discoverability** (through cataloging), and **traceability** (through versioning and lineage), which together uphold scientific rigor in data usage.

## 3. AI/ML Layer (Local Inference, Training with GPU Support, Containerized Workflows)

* **JupyterHub for Notebooks & Compute Environments:** The platform employs **JupyterHub** to provide researchers and students with interactive computing environments (Jupyter Notebooks/Lab) accessible through the browser. JupyterHub is an open-source multi-user server for Jupyter notebooks that “brings the power of notebooks to groups of users” and gives them access to computational resources without the burden of installing anything locally. Each user (after login) can spawn their own isolated notebook server on the Kubernetes cluster. These notebook servers run in Docker containers (often using standard Jupyter Docker stacks or custom images preloaded with commonly used libraries like pandas, PyTorch, R, etc.). Because the environment is containerized, every user gets a consistent setup, eliminating the “works on my machine” problem. JupyterHub integrates with the platform’s authentication system (single sign-on, see Access Control section) so that only authorized users (e.g., members of certain projects) can spawn notebooks. The notebooks interface allows users to write code (in Python, R, Julia, etc.), run data analyses, train models, and visualize results – all through a familiar web UI. Importantly, the notebook servers have access to the Nextcloud storage (for example, via mounting the Ceph storage or using Nextcloud’s WebDAV – the configuration can mount users’ Nextcloud directories into their notebook container). This means a student can load a dataset directly in Python by accessing a file path or API corresponding to their Nextcloud files. JupyterHub is highly scalable and customizable: it can support from a handful to thousands of users by leveraging K8s auto-scaling, and we can tailor resource quotas (e.g., some users may get more CPU or GPU if needed). By using JupyterHub, the platform caters to a broad range of technical skill levels – novices get an easy-to-use web notebook, and advanced users can utilize the full Python/R ecosystem in a reproducible environment. Because Jupyter notebooks are a de-facto standard in data science, using this open tool aligns with what users know, and notebooks themselves support reproducibility (they can be version controlled and exported as scripts or HTML for transparency).

* **GPU-Accelerated Computing:** For AI and heavy data science tasks, the architecture includes **GPU support** on-premises. Servers equipped with NVIDIA GPUs (or other accelerators) are joined to the Kubernetes cluster (using NVIDIA’s open-source K8s device plugin to make GPUs schedulable to containers). This allows notebook servers or batch jobs to leverage GPU hardware for training machine learning models (for example, training a deep learning model on supply chain risk data) or for fast parallel computation (like large matrix operations). The stack uses open GPU drivers and CUDA libraries on DAT Linux so that frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch can run at full speed. A researcher can request a GPU-enabled notebook image (the platform can provide separate GPU base images with the necessary libraries) and JupyterHub/Kubernetes will schedule their container on a GPU node. This way, AI model training that may take hours on a CPU can be accelerated. For distributed training (across multiple GPUs or nodes), the platform can integrate libraries such as Horovod or PyTorch’s distributed training – Kubernetes can coordinate multi-container jobs for this if needed. The key is that all GPU usage is done using open source software stacks (CUDA is free, and ML frameworks are open source) and containerization ensures the correct versions of CUDA/CuDNN, etc., are present. **Local inference**: Once models are trained, they can be used for inference either inside notebooks or deployed as lightweight services (for example, via an API – see API Gateway in optional section). The platform’s GPU support means even at inference time, if a model is complex (e.g., large neural network), it can utilize GPUs for faster predictions. By having on-prem GPU capability, the sensitive data (which might be needed for inference or additional training) does not have to leave the secure environment, which is important for industry partners’ privacy. Moreover, because this GPU infrastructure is under our control, we avoid expensive proprietary AI cloud services and ensure researchers can experiment freely with configurations.

* **Containerized Workflows & ML Pipelines:** In addition to interactive notebooks, the AI/ML layer supports running batch **machine learning workflows** in a reproducible, automated manner. These workflows are defined as code (or pipeline configurations) and run in containers on the cluster, ensuring that the same steps can be executed anytime on potentially different hardware and yield the same results. For example, a data preprocessing step, a model training step, and an evaluation step could be defined as separate containerized tasks. The platform could use a workflow orchestrator like **Apache Airflow** or Kubeflow Pipelines (open source) to chain these steps, or simply rely on the CI/CD system to trigger them (see Reproducibility section). By containerizing each step, we encapsulate the exact environment (libraries, etc.) needed for that step. This means a training job that ran in January can be re-run in June in exactly the same environment, guaranteeing consistent behavior. If Airflow is used, data scientists can schedule periodic retraining jobs (for instance, retrain a forecasting model every month when new data is ingested) and monitor them via Airflow’s UI. The orchestration can also ensure that dependencies between tasks are respected (e.g., do not run evaluation until training output is ready) – all defined in code for transparency. For quick iterative work, users will often rely on notebooks, but when something needs to be formalized into a pipeline (for reproducibility or regular re-use), they can containerize it and plug it into this workflow system. This approach aligns with *MLOps* best practices, bringing DevOps-style automation to research code. All tools here (Airflow, Kubeflow, etc.) are open source, meaning the team can modify pipelines without restriction and benefit from community contributions (e.g., Airflow has many pre-built operators for common tasks). The AI/ML layer also includes experiment tracking tools (optionally) like **MLflow** for recording model metrics and parameters across runs, which is open source and can be hosted on the same servers. This adds to reproducibility by keeping a log of what hyperparameters or data versions produced each result.

**Justification:** This layer transforms the raw data into insights and models, providing both interactive and automated means to do so. JupyterHub was chosen because it dramatically lowers the barrier to entry: users get immediate access to a full data science environment through their browser, with no local installs needed. This is ideal for a collaborative setting with mixed skill levels and ensures uniform environments (which is crucial when dozens of students need the same results – they’re all running on the same setup). The open nature of JupyterHub (supporting various tools and interfaces) means it can accommodate diverse workflows (not just Jupyter Notebook, but RStudio or MATLAB alternatives could be integrated if needed). GPU support is critical for modern AI research; by using open solutions to integrate GPUs (like Kubernetes + NVIDIA plugin), we ensure the platform can handle compute-intensive tasks with high performance. Containerized workflows ensure that once a research analysis is ready to be formalized (e.g., for a publication or a production model for an industry partner), it can be executed repeatedly with the same results, reinforcing reproducibility. Every tool in this AI/ML layer – Jupyter, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Airflow, etc. – is open source, which means researchers can inspect the code (important for trust in scientific tools), and there’s no dependency on proprietary software that others might not have (a common reproducibility hurdle). Furthermore, this openness and containerization allow easy sharing of the computational environment itself: for instance, we could publish the Docker images of our environment along with a paper, so others can pull that image and run the code to reproduce results. In summary, the AI/ML layer provides powerful computation (with GPUs and distributed computing) while maintaining the *reproducibility of the computational process* (through notebooks, containers, and pipelines).

## 4. Web Interface and User Interaction (Dashboards, Notebooks, Workflow Runners)

* **Nextcloud Web Portal for Data & Collaboration:** The primary user interface for data access is through Nextcloud’s web portal. Through any modern web browser, users can log into Nextcloud and see a **dashboard of files and folders** they have access to. This interface is intuitive and similar to popular cloud storage services, which lowers the learning curve for new users and non-technical stakeholders. Academics and students can create project folders, upload datasets (via drag-and-drop or the upload button), and organize them hierarchically. Industry partners can be given access to specific shared folders where they might drop data or retrieve analysis results. Nextcloud supports rich previews (for images, PDFs, even some CSV/spreadsheet previews) allowing users to quickly inspect data files without downloading. It also has integrated file editing via add-ons (for example, OnlyOffice or Collabora Online) so that simple data files or documents can be viewed/edited in the browser if needed. Crucially, Nextcloud provides **desktop sync clients and mobile apps** (all open source) for all major platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS). A researcher can synchronize a folder to their laptop using the Nextcloud client and then use their native tools (Excel, Python IDE, etc.) on those files; changes will sync back to the server. This satisfies the “system-native tools” access: users aren’t forced to use the web UI if they prefer working locally. They can, for example, run a local R script on data that’s kept in sync with the central storage. Nextcloud’s transparent multi-platform access is a big advantage – as the official site notes, it enables productivity **“across any platform… providing transparent access to data on any storage”**. In practice, this means an academic can start an analysis in a browser on a university lab computer, continue working on the dataset from their laptop on a train (offline, via sync), and the data stays consistent. For larger files, Nextcloud’s web interface also allows creating shareable links (with password protection or expiration, if needed) which can be used to deliver data to external parties securely. Moreover, the Nextcloud interface is extensible: we can add custom apps to integrate other parts of the platform. For example, there is a Nextcloud app for JupyterHub integration which could let users launch notebooks directly from Nextcloud or see their running notebooks status in the Nextcloud dashboard. Overall, the Nextcloud web UI serves as the **hub for data discovery and sharing** – it’s where users go first to find or share a dataset, read documentation files, and discuss data (via comments on files or built-in chat if enabled). Its user-friendliness and familiarity ensure that even industry partners who may not be data scientists can comfortably use the platform for accessing data.

* **Jupyter Notebooks & Visualizations:** For interactive analysis, the primary UI is Jupyter notebooks (accessed via JupyterHub). When a user launches JupyterLab from JupyterHub, they get an IDE-like web interface with their notebooks, a file browser (connected to their data directories), terminals, etc. This environment allows them to write code, run it, see outputs, and create rich **visualizations** (plots, charts, maps) inline. It’s essentially their “laboratory workbench” on the platform. Users can develop step-by-step analyses here, which is valuable for exploratory research. Additionally, the platform supports turning these analyses into **dashboards and reports** that can be shared with others who may not want to read code. For example, using libraries like Plotly Dash or Voila, a user can convert a Jupyter notebook into an interactive dashboard application. Such dashboards (which are Python code under the hood) can be deployed on the platform (for instance, served via a lightweight web server in a container) to provide an interface where one can select parameters and see charts update. This is useful for demonstrating findings to industry partners: e.g., an interactive visualization of supply chain performance where the partner can filter by region or date. The architecture can include an instance of **Apache Superset** or **Grafana** as well – these open-source tools allow creation of charts and dashboards from data with SQL or minimal coding. Superset, for example, could be connected to analysis results in a PostgreSQL database or CSV files to let users slice data and create visual reports via a GUI. Grafana might be used if there are time-series metrics (say, real-time supply chain KPIs) to monitor, as it excels in real-time dashboarding. All these visualization and dashboarding tools are open source, which means they can be integrated without licensing issues and their output (charts, etc.) can be easily shared or exported. The platform’s web layer would thus have a section for “Dashboards/Reports” where authorized users can view these interactive results. The combination of Jupyter (for deep analysis) and dashboard tools (for broad sharing) covers the range of user needs: researchers can do the heavy analysis and then present it in an accessible form to decision-makers. Notably, Jupyter itself allows exporting notebooks to static formats (HTML, PDF) – a researcher can produce a nicely formatted report with code, results, and narrative and save it to Nextcloud for record-keeping or sharing. The **workflow runners** (like Airflow’s web UI or CI pipeline views) also count as part of the user interaction layer: they provide interfaces for power users to manage the automated pipelines. For instance, Airflow’s web UI shows a DAG (directed acyclic graph) of tasks, with statuses and logs; a data engineer can use that to manage data updates or model retraining schedules. Similarly, if using Jenkins or GitLab CI, users can see the status of pipeline runs through their web interface. Those interfaces are mostly for the technical team ensuring the platform’s processes are healthy, whereas Nextcloud and notebooks are for daily research work.

* **User Experience and Integration:** All web interfaces are integrated via single sign-on, so users don’t juggle multiple logins (discussed later). We also ensure that navigation between them is as smooth as possible: e.g., placing links in Nextcloud to the notebook environment and vice versa. The idea is to present the **illusion of a single unified portal** for the researchers, even though under the hood multiple specialized tools are working together. For example, an “Analysis” menu in Nextcloud could redirect to JupyterHub, and a “Data” button in JupyterLab could open the Nextcloud file picker. This integration can be achieved with existing plugins or some custom web development (since all tools have APIs). By doing so, we make it easy for a user to jump between browsing data, analyzing data, and viewing results, which matches a typical research workflow loop. The platform’s UI is accessible via secure HTTPS from anywhere (assuming the deployment is accessible on the internet or via VPN for external partners). Also, Nextcloud’s mobile app means even on a mobile device, a user could quickly look up a file or get a notification if something was shared with them, increasing engagement. Altogether, the web interface layer focuses on **usability and collaboration**: Nextcloud for sharing and discussion around data, Jupyter for analysis, and optional dashboards for communicating insights. By using widely adopted open interfaces (Nextcloud and Jupyter both have large user bases), the platform ensures users feel comfortable and require minimal training. This is particularly important for interdisciplinary projects – a business stakeholder might only use the Nextcloud web UI to download a report, while a student uses JupyterLab extensively; the platform supports both seamlessly.

**Justification:** A key measure of the platform’s success is user adoption, which ties directly to the interface’s friendliness and the ability to use familiar tools. Nextcloud was selected because it’s proven as a user-friendly interface for file sharing with **enterprise-grade features and a familiar “cloud drive” experience**. Its open-source nature doesn’t sacrifice quality – it actually *exceeds* many proprietary solutions in features relevant to research (like fine-grained sharing controls and integration of online office apps). Jupyter is the de facto standard for data science notebooks, so using it means we tap into existing user knowledge and a rich ecosystem of extensions. The open interfaces also promote transparency: since Nextcloud is just a layer over our storage, advanced users can bypass the web UI and use WebDAV or the sync client to script interactions. This kind of flexibility is only possible because we chose open standards and protocols at the UI layer. Additionally, by providing mechanisms for interactive dashboards and visualization (Superset, Grafana, etc.), we ensure that insights derived from the data can be **communicated effectively** to different stakeholders. This is crucial in supply chain research, where one needs to convey complex analysis results (like risk predictions or optimization outcomes) to decision-makers who may not read code or statistical outputs. The entire UI/UX approach prioritizes making the powerful back-end capabilities accessible and easy to use. In effect, the web interface is designed so that the complexity under the hood (containers, orchestration, data lineage, etc.) is invisible to the end-user; they interact with a polished, cohesive environment. Because all these UI components are open source, we can deeply integrate them (for example, unify themes/branding, single sign-on) and we can trust their security (open code vetted by the community). The result is a **collaboration platform** that feels unified and user-centric, encouraging all stakeholders to actively use it rather than resorting to ad-hoc tools outside the system.

## 5. Access Control and Sharing (Roles, Group Permissions, Data Licensing)

* **Role-Based User Profiles:** The platform defines clear user roles – for instance **Academic Researchers**, **Students**, and **Industry Partners** – each potentially mapped to different permissions and access scopes. Using an open-source identity management system like **Keycloak**, we manage all user accounts and groups centrally. Keycloak (or a similar OpenID Connect/SAML provider) is integrated with the organization’s directory if available (e.g., a university LDAP or Active Directory, or we create an internal user DB for external partners). This central IAM handles authentication and single sign-on for all services: when a user logs into Nextcloud or JupyterHub, it delegates to Keycloak (or Nextcloud’s built-in OAuth2 which we configure similarly) which then confirms identity and role. Roles and group memberships are then passed to the services. For example, we might have groups like “Project Alpha – Researchers” or “Industry Partner – CompanyX” to segregate access. **Nextcloud permissions:** Nextcloud supports advanced sharing and access control. We utilize Nextcloud’s **Group Folders** app and ACL (Access Control List) features to set up shared folders for specific groups. For instance, all internal researchers might have a shared folder “Internal Data” that industry partners cannot see, whereas a folder “Partner Data Exchange” is shared read-write with a particular company partner group. Nextcloud’s advanced permissions allow specifying read/write/upload rights on a per-folder or per-share basis. Only users explicitly given access will see a research data folder, fulfilling the principle of least privilege. Sysadmins can control this granularly – as noted in a Nextcloud case study, you can limit access such that *“only a handful of people will need to open the research folders”*. Thus, sensitive data is only accessible to the appropriate role. We can also enforce measures like **watermarking** on downloaded PDFs or documents for certain confidential files (Nextcloud can watermark files in public shares or GUI views) to discourage unauthorized redistribution. Additionally, Nextcloud allows setting expiration dates or passwords on share links, which we use when sending data to external parties to enforce time-bound access. All these controls are configurable through Nextcloud’s UI, making it easy for administrators to manage permissions without editing low-level configs.

* **Sharing Workflows and Auditing:** The platform implements clear workflows for data sharing. For example, an industry partner might upload a dataset to a “dropbox” folder that only they and the relevant academics can access. Automatic Nextcloud **Flow** rules (an automation feature) could notify the researchers when new data arrives or even trigger an ingestion pipeline. Conversely, when researchers have results to share with a partner, they can put them in a designated output folder that the partner group has read access to. Every access or download can be logged (Nextcloud provides logging and can even integrate with audit trail apps), so we maintain an audit of who accessed what data and when – an important aspect when dealing with potentially sensitive supply chain information. For internal collaboration, Nextcloud’s sharing encourages open science practices: within the research group, data can be easily shared rather than siloed, but with oversight. Nextcloud also supports **federated sharing**, meaning if a partner organization also runs Nextcloud, the two instances can share files directly server-to-server. This is a purely optional feature but shows the extensibility if, say, multiple universities each host part of the data.

* **Data Licensing and Metadata Policies:** Each dataset in the platform is accompanied by clear licensing or usage terms to ensure proper use and compliance. We use the metadata catalog (Atlas/Amundsen) to record a “License” field for each dataset (e.g., CC-BY, internal-use-only, etc.). For instance, academic datasets might be open to all collaborators under a Creative Commons license, while company-provided data might be “Proprietary – research use only”. These terms are also noted in a README file stored with the data in Nextcloud or in Nextcloud’s **description field** for that folder, to be absolutely clear to anyone accessing it. Although the platform cannot automatically enforce a license (beyond access control), making the terms visible and agreed upon is critical. If needed, we can integrate a simple click-through agreement in Nextcloud (some deployments add an initial login screen for users to accept data usage policies). Because everything is open source, implementing such custom behaviors is feasible (e.g., using Nextcloud’s theming and custom app capabilities). Additionally, the platform’s openness allows integrating with external compliance tools if needed (for example, using Apache Ranger or similar for policy enforcement on who can query what data – especially if we integrate federated query engines, see optional section). The **data governance** team (admins) can utilize the catalog and Nextcloud logs to ensure licensing compliance, making adjustments to permissions if a dataset’s status changes (e.g., embargo lifted -> make it accessible to more users).

* **Secure External Access:** Industry partners or external collaborators are given accounts in the system but with restricted visibility and capabilities. For example, an external partner might not even see the JupyterHub or other internal tools – they may only have a Nextcloud login to specific folders, unless they are deeply involved in joint analysis (in which case they could be given notebook access too). The platform uses secure protocols (HTTPS, VPN if required) and two-factor authentication via Keycloak for any external user logins to mitigate unauthorized access. We configure strong password policies and optional 2FA in Keycloak (which supports TOTP, SMS, etc.). This ensures that sharing with external parties does not compromise the platform’s security. Since Nextcloud is built with privacy in mind (no data goes to third-party servers, and it even can encrypt data at rest if configured), it satisfies industry partners’ needs for confidentiality. In fact, Nextcloud highlights features like **password-protected shares, no metadata leaks, and on-prem control** as reasons it’s trusted in research and enterprise. The platform can thus reassure partners that their data is safe and only used as agreed.

* **Collaboration Features:** Access control isn’t just about restrictions; it also enables collaboration. Within allowed groups, users can collaborate on files (Nextcloud’s Office integration allows multiple people editing a document or spreadsheet together in real-time, for instance). This could be useful when preparing joint reports or data dictionaries. Nextcloud Talk (an optional add-on) could provide a chat/video channel for project teams, staying within the platform to discuss data securely rather than using external tools. All these collaboration features inherit the same access controls (only authorized users in a chat room, etc.), ensuring confidential discussions remain internal. The open-source nature again allows these capabilities without relying on external SaaS tools that might not be approved for sensitive data.

**Justification:** Robust access control and sharing mechanisms are absolutely essential in a platform that spans academic and industry collaboration. We chose Nextcloud for this role because it has **state-of-the-art access controls trusted by customers and community**, and it is specifically mentioned as a solution for research institutes concerned with confidentiality. Using open-source IAM (Keycloak) and Nextcloud’s built-in sharing features means we can tailor the access model exactly to our needs, rather than being stuck with a one-size-fits-all. The ability to limit access “down to a tee” – specifying who can read, edit, or even see each item – gives fine-grained control to protect sensitive data. At the same time, legitimate collaboration is smooth: researchers can share data with a click of a button rather than going through bureaucratic IT processes, which encourages them to actually use the central platform (preventing the emergence of shadow IT or personal Dropbox usage). All changes are transparent and reversible by admins (since it’s open source, we can always query the database or logs to audit shares). The inclusion of license metadata addresses the often overlooked issue of data usage agreements. By making licenses visible and using open metadata standards to store them, we promote ethical and legal compliance. Additionally, because the platform is entirely open, organizations are free to undergo external security audits on the code or integrate national identity systems (for example, some academic federations use Shibboleth/SAML – our setup can accommodate that because we control the stack). The end result is a secure collaboration environment where data providers (like companies) feel comfortable sharing data (knowing access is controlled and usage is governed), and researchers have the freedom to access what they need for discovery. The platform protects against data leaks and unauthorized access through strong open-source security features, ensuring that trust between academia and industry is maintained. It’s worth noting that the **100% open-source nature reduces any risk of hidden backdoors or unwanted data telemetry** – unlike some proprietary solutions, our platform doesn’t send data to any vendor. This sovereignty over data is often a deciding factor for industry partners in finance and supply chain domains.

## 6. Reproducibility and CI/CD for Research Workflows (Pipeline Testing, Versioned Results)

* **Source Control and Environment Management:** All analysis code, model scripts, and even configuration files are managed in a Git repository (hosted on an open-source Git service like **GitLab CE or Gitea** deployed on the platform). Researchers are expected to version control their notebooks (or at least the .py/.R scripts exported from them) and any supporting code. This not only facilitates collaboration (multiple people can work on the same code base with proper versioning) but is the first step toward reproducibility: the exact code used for an analysis is saved and can be retrieved by anyone later. To capture the computational environment, we use **Docker containers or conda environments** specified as code. For instance, each project might have a `Dockerfile` or an `environment.yml` that lists all dependencies (library versions, etc.). These environment definitions are stored in Git alongside the code. The platform’s CI system can automatically build these project-specific Docker images. By having environment specifications under version control, we ensure that another person (or the CI runner) can recreate the same environment in which the original analysis was done. This practice addresses a common cause of irreproducibility: differences in library versions or OS setups. With containerization, we lock down the environment – if the code says it was using TensorFlow 2.4 on Python 3.8, that’s exactly what the container provides everywhere. Researchers benefit because they don’t have to manually set up dependencies on the cluster; the CI will prepare it, or the JupyterHub can even directly use the Docker images built for the project. Additionally, by using only open-source languages and libraries in our environment, we heed the guideline that **others can reproduce the work without needing proprietary software licenses** – for example, using Python’s open libraries instead of a commercial tool ensures anyone can install the same tools freely.

* **Continuous Integration (CI) Pipelines:** The platform includes a CI/CD service, such as **Jenkins** or **GitLab CI**, to automate testing and execution of research workflows. Whenever code is updated or on a defined schedule, the CI system triggers pipelines that run analysis scripts in a controlled manner. For example, if a researcher pushes a change to a data processing script in Git, the CI can automatically run that script on a small sample data to verify it works (unit tests for data code). More comprehensively, we can have a pipeline that goes from raw data to final result: pulling latest data, running cleaning, then model training, then generating figures or outputs. The CI pipeline uses the Docker images described above to run each step, meaning each job runs in an isolated, reproducible environment. GitLab CI in particular has a powerful feature where each job can use a specified Docker image – we leverage this so that, say, the “analysis” job uses the project’s analysis image. This approach was highlighted by an NYU reproducibility expert noting that built-in CI with Docker allows one to run each job in a “separate and isolated container” ensuring consistency. The continuous aspect ensures that even as code evolves, we constantly verify that everything still runs correctly, which is important when multiple people are collaborating or adding new data. If an error is introduced, the CI will catch it immediately (failing tests), rather than it causing irreproducible results later. The CI pipelines also produce **artifacts** – e.g., intermediate files, final model binaries, or compiled reports – which can be automatically archived. We configure the CI to save key outputs and upload them to Nextcloud or the data catalog (or store as GitLab artifacts with a retention policy). This means that every run of an analysis pipeline has a recorded output that can be retrieved. If someone says “the analysis from last week gave a different result,” we can go into the CI artifacts and pull the exact outputs from that run to compare. Multi-stage pipelines are used to mirror how a human would run things: stage 1: prepare data, stage 2: run analysis, stage 3: validate results, stage 4: deploy or publish results (like update a dashboard). Each stage can depend on the previous and can also reuse artifacts from earlier stages to avoid re-computation. We also leverage features like **multi-project pipelines** where appropriate – for example, if one repository contains common code or datasets and another contains a specific analysis, a change in the common repo could trigger the downstream analysis pipelines to re-run. This ensures consistency across projects.

* **Testing and Validation:** We incorporate automated testing of analysis wherever possible. This could mean simple smoke tests (does the script run without errors on a small sample?) and correctness tests (for example, does a known small input produce an expected output?). Tools like **Great Expectations** (open source) can be used to test data quality – e.g., after an ETL job, check that certain assumptions hold (columns present, no negative values where impossible, etc.). We also use Jupyter’s nbval or Papermill to validate notebooks: nbval allows treating notebook outputs as tests so that if outputs change beyond a tolerance, the test fails. This catches unintended changes in results. By formalizing tests, we ensure that the CI/CD system isn’t just running code, but also checking that results stay consistent given the same inputs. This helps guard against environment drift or accidental code modifications that could alter results. For instance, if a model’s output metric changes significantly when it shouldn’t (because there was no new data), that might indicate a problem which the team can then investigate. These tests add confidence that if the pipeline passes, the results are reliable and thus can be published or shared.

* **Versioned Results and Artifacts:** When an analysis pipeline completes successfully (whether manually or via CI), we tag the resulting outputs with a version (which could be a Git commit hash, a date, or a semantic version if appropriate). The data catalog is updated to link to this versioned result. For example, a model training might produce `model_v1.0.pkl` along with evaluation metrics; this is stored (in Nextcloud or a model registry) and cataloged as version 1.0 of that model. If later retraining produces `model_v1.1.pkl`, both versions are retained so researchers can compare or rollback if needed. Likewise, for analytical outputs like figures or reports, we don’t just overwrite them; the CI could timestamp them or push them to a versioned directory. This approach means that the platform accumulates a history of results, supporting the scholarly need to reference exactly which version of an analysis was used in a publication. It also means if an industry partner is basing a decision on a report, and later the data changes, one can always reproduce the original report by checking out the old version from the system. To manage storage, we might not keep every single artifact indefinitely, but key milestone versions and anything linked to published findings are preserved. The integration of DVC mentioned earlier ties in here: DVC can version not just the input data but also outputs (if configured to track certain output files), and it generates a `dvc.lock` file that captures the exact versions of inputs used. By storing those in Git, we have a precise map of what produced each result.

* **Continuous Deployment (CD) of Models/Dashboards:** For parts of the platform that need deployment (like updating a dashboard app or deploying a trained model for others to use), we also implement CD. For instance, if a new model is validated and we want to expose it via an API or dashboard, the CI can automatically deploy that container (perhaps updating a Kubernetes service or reloading a Streamlit app). Because this question is more about research platform and less about production deployment, this is optional – but it shows that the line between research and usable output can be bridged within the same platform. An example: an optimal inventory policy computed by the research can be packaged as a small web service; whenever the model is retrained and tested via CI, the service gets updated with the new model parameters, all in an automated pipeline. This ensures that the “latest best knowledge” is always reflected in the tools that partners might use, with minimal manual steps.

**Justification:** Reproducibility is a cornerstone of credible research. Our architecture deeply embeds reproducibility by *design*, not as an afterthought. By using Git and CI/CD, we borrow the proven practices of software engineering and apply them to research (often called DataOps or MLOps in context). This systematic approach addresses the common pitfalls: how many times have researchers struggled to rerun someone else’s code only to find dependency issues or missing steps? Here, every analysis is treated as code that runs on the platform itself regularly, so issues are discovered and fixed early. The benefit for researchers is huge – it automates repetitive tasks (no need to manually rerun whole pipelines) and frees them to focus on thinking rather than tinkering with environments. The benefit for industry partners and other stakeholders is trust: they can trust the results because they know the results are reproducible on demand. If needed, they could be given access to the CI logs or even allowed to trigger a rerun themselves (for transparency). The open source tools used (GitLab/Jenkins, etc.) are familiar in DevOps, making it easier to hire support or consult community forums if we need to extend functionality. As the GitLab case study notes, an integrated platform that ships with CI and uses Docker images allows researchers to leverage these features for their communities’ benefit. The platform’s approach ensures that *every piece of the puzzle is captured*: data versions, code, environment, and even the execution process (pipelines). This achieves what the 2013 ICERM report described as the highest level of reproducibility: **“open and reproducible research – everything is made available for others to examine and use”**. Indeed, someone else could take our Git repos and Docker images (all open source) and re-run the entire analysis on a different machine, which is the gold standard. Moreover, our CI setup is not static – it can adapt. As research evolves or new tests are needed, we update the pipelines (which are just files in Git). This makes the *research process* itself version-controlled and improvable. In essence, we have a built-in guarantee that if something worked before, it will continue to work, or we’ll immediately know why not. This drastically reduces the “it worked last year, but now we can’t replicate it” scenario that plagues long-term projects. By integrating CI/CD and treating infrastructure as code, we also ease the process of migrating or scaling the platform: everything is scripted, so deploying the whole stack in a new environment (on new servers or cloud) would be straightforward – further enhancing resilience and openness (others can set up the same platform elsewhere to validate our work). The commitment to open source in CI (using Jenkins or GitLab CE instead of a proprietary CI service) ensures that all pipeline definitions and operations are fully visible and under our control, again avoiding any hidden complexities. In conclusion, this CI/CD and reproducibility focus ensures **research outputs remain trustworthy and verifiable over time**, which is especially important when bridging academic rigor with industry impact.

## 7. Optional Integrations and Extensions

*(The following integrations can enhance the platform as needed, but are not mandatory for the core operation. They provide additional capabilities for specialized use cases like multi-institution collaboration or productionizing the research outputs.)*

* **Federated Data Query Engines:** In scenarios where data is not all centralized in the Nextcloud/Ceph storage (for example, some data may remain in external databases or data lakes due to governance), the platform can integrate a federated query engine like **Trino (PrestoSQL)**. Trino is an open-source distributed SQL query engine that can query data across multiple sources using a single SQL interface. By deploying Trino on the platform, researchers could run analytics that joins data from, say, the Nextcloud CSV files, a partner’s PostgreSQL database, and perhaps a cloud storage bucket, all in one query. Trino will fetch and combine data from all configured connectors in real time. This is powerful for supply chain research, as supply chain data often resides in different systems (ERP, warehouse DB, financial systems). Instead of manually exporting everything into the platform, Trino allows leaving data in place and querying “through” the platform. We would configure Trino with connectors for our Ceph (it can treat Ceph or Nextcloud files as an Hive/CSV data source), for external SQL databases, or even for APIs if a connector exists. Proper access control is maintained by only allowing Trino to access sources the user has rights to (Trino can integrate with our Keycloak for authentication and use Apache Ranger or its internal access control for authorization on data sources). Federated querying speeds up research by removing data silo barriers. It also means our platform can act as a **data hub**, not just a data repository – enabling queries on “virtual datasets” that span institutions. Trino’s ability to handle large-scale data with parallel processing ensures that even very large external datasets can be analyzed without first performing a slow bulk import. And since Trino is open source and originally built at Facebook for exactly “SQL on everything”, it’s a proven choice. Researchers can use tools like Superset or Jupyter to submit Trino queries and get results, all within the platform’s network.

* **Distributed Computation and Scaling Out:** The architecture is designed to scale horizontally. For on-premises expansion, more DAT Linux servers can be added to the Kubernetes cluster to increase capacity (for compute or storage). In addition, the design supports cloud bursting: connecting cloud-based nodes or services when extra resources are needed. Kubernetes being cloud-agnostic makes this straightforward – e.g., using a cluster federation or Kubernetes Cluster API, we can attach an **auto-scaling group of cloud VMs** that join the cluster during heavy workloads and terminate afterward. This hybrid approach might be used if, for example, a huge dataset needs processing that exceeds on-prem capacity; the CI/CD or Airflow job could tag itself to run on “cloud” nodes which then spin up. All open-source tooling (like Terraform for provisioning, or Kubernetes itself) is used to manage this, maintaining the open ethos. Alternatively, if some computations are better suited for an HPC environment (like MPI jobs for very large optimization problems), the platform can integrate with HPC schedulers (such as **Slurm**). Slurm is open source and could be configured to treat the Kubernetes cluster or separate HPC nodes as a batch system for certain jobs – or we can simply export data to an HPC cluster and import results back, depending on need. The key point is flexibility: the architecture isn’t locked to one deployment; it can distribute computation across any available infrastructure while presenting a unified interface to users. This protects the investment in the platform as research demands grow: we can always scale using commodity hardware or cloud without re-architecting. The **Ceph storage** is also scalable: we can add more OSD nodes (storage drives) to increase capacity and throughput, so the storage grows with the data. Since Ceph is open source, we avoid proprietary storage limits and can even consider multi-site replication (Ceph can replicate data across data centers), enabling a form of **geographically distributed platform** if partnering universities each host a Ceph cluster that mirrors certain datasets. That way, each site can compute locally on its chunk of data but share globally – aligning with federated setups some research consortia prefer.

* **API Gateway for External Integrations:** To facilitate programmatic access to the platform’s data and models, we can deploy an **API gateway** such as **Kong** (open source) in front of certain services. Kong is built for hybrid/multi-cloud environments and would allow us to expose selected APIs securely. For instance, if we develop a predictive model for supply chain risks and want partner systems to consume it, we can expose an endpoint `/api/predict` via Kong. Kong will handle authentication (verifying API tokens via Keycloak), rate limiting, and routing to the appropriate service (maybe a Flask app serving the model inside the cluster). Similarly, if external applications want to query data (instead of using Nextcloud manually), we could provide a REST or GraphQL API to search the data catalog or fetch certain data slices. The API gateway ensures these requests are managed safely and efficiently. It can also provide a unified API entry point aggregating multiple internal services. Because Kong is extensible (plugin architecture), we can add logging, monitoring, transformation or other policies easily. Having an API layer extends the platform from being researcher-focused to enabling integration with operational systems. For example, an industry partner might integrate their live dashboard software with our API to pull the latest research-generated insights nightly. Or a mobile app for students could use an API to fetch data for a project. All of this is possible without compromising security, thanks to the gateway. Moreover, since Kong and similar gateways are cloud-native, they slot right into our K8s deployment (Kong has a Kubernetes Operator). This optional component essentially prepares the platform for any use-case where automation or external software needs to interface with the platform’s outputs. By staying open source here, we avoid proprietary API management that could limit deployment flexibility or incur costs per request.

* **Monitoring and Logging:** (Supplementary to ensure smooth operation) The platform can integrate open source monitoring tools like **Prometheus** and **ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** stack. Prometheus would collect metrics from all services (CPU, memory, response times, GPU usage, etc.) to ensure the cluster is healthy and to auto-scale if needed. Kibana (with Elasticsearch or OpenSearch) can be used to aggregate logs from Nextcloud, JupyterHub, Keycloak, etc., for easier debugging and auditing. These tools, being open source, further increase transparency – administrators and even researchers (if given access to a Kibana dashboard) can see what’s happening under the hood (e.g., how long a query took, or if any errors occurred last night). This is optional but highly recommended in a persistent platform to maintain reliability.

**Justification:** The optional integrations elevate the platform from a standalone setup to a collaborative networked ecosystem. Federated querying acknowledges that not all data can be copied into one place; by using a tool like Trino, we adhere to the principle of bringing computation to the data (when data sharing is restricted) rather than forcing all data to come to the computation. This is especially relevant in multi-party supply chain studies where some data may be confidential and only queryable in aggregate. The open-source solution we propose (Trino) was explicitly designed for such “SQL on everything” scenarios and avoids any proprietary data virtualization product, keeping the tech accessible to all partners. The distributed computing aspect ensures scalability – by planning for horizontal scale and hybrid cloud, we make the architecture future-proof. If the research group gets a grant for more hardware or needs to leverage cloud credits, the architecture can incorporate those easily. This modular scalability again leverages open standards (Kubernetes, Ceph) to avoid tying us to a single vendor’s scaling solution. The API gateway extension is about bridging research with real-world usage: often a successful research output needs to be consumed by other software, and providing an API is the way to do that. By including an open gateway like Kong, we ensure any such integration can happen securely and efficiently. Kong’s note as *“cloud-native, platform-agnostic, scalable”* fits well with our hybrid vision. Importantly, doing this via an open gateway means we’re not locked into a cloud provider’s API management system – which aligns with our vendor-neutral approach. Overall, these integrations underscore that our platform not only serves the immediate research needs but can adapt to complex deployment scenarios (multi-site, multi-cloud) and additional uses (embedding results into partner workflows). This flexibility, rooted again in open source tech, gives stakeholders confidence that investing in this platform yields a long-term collaborative infrastructure that can grow and integrate as their needs evolve.

## Conclusion

In summary, the proposed architecture combines a suite of fully open-source components into a cohesive platform for supply chain data sharing and AI research. We have outlined a **core stack** (DAT Linux, containers, Kubernetes, Nextcloud, Ceph) that provides a stable, scalable foundation with no proprietary dependencies. On top of this, robust **data management practices** (ingestion pipelines, metadata cataloging, version control) ensure that all data is well-organized, documented, and reproducible. The integrated **AI/ML environment** (JupyterHub with GPU support and containerized workflows) empowers researchers to leverage advanced analytics and machine learning on the data, within a consistent and shareable setup. A user-friendly **web interface** layer (Nextcloud and JupyterLab, plus optional dashboards) makes the platform accessible to users with varying technical backgrounds, encouraging collaboration and frequent use. Fine-grained **access control** mechanisms protect sensitive information while enabling seamless sharing among authorized parties, a balance that is critical in academia-industry partnerships. Finally, built-in **reproducibility and CI/CD pipelines** treat analyses as live, versioned processes that can be re-run and validated at any time, cementing the credibility of research findings. Every major component choice was justified in terms of suitability for scientific work: openness (no black boxes; all source code available for inspection), reproducibility (ensuring others can obtain the same results given the same inputs), scalability (ability to handle growing data and user loads, and to utilize cloud resources if needed), and ease of use (lowering barriers for users so the platform actually gets used and loved).

By adhering to open-source standards, we also foster an environment of **innovation and community support**. New tools or updates can be integrated without waiting for vendor roadmaps – e.g., if a new data science tool emerges, we can install it on DAT Linux or add a container for it. The platform can evolve with the state of the art. Additionally, using popular open projects means our team can tap into existing expertise and documentation (for instance, many universities have similar JupyterHub setups, many enterprises use Nextcloud for collaboration, etc., so knowledge is transferable). This reduces risk and training time.

Reviewing the architecture, one can see that it essentially forms a **research pipeline** from raw data to actionable insight, with every step traceable and repeatable. A supply chain analyst can ingest new logistics data, train a predictive model, share the model and predictions with industry partners, and do all this in a collaborative, secure workspace that others can join or reproduce on their own. Stakeholders can be confident in results because the platform enforces good data practices and transparent compute environments. Moreover, because all components are self-hosted and open, the university (or hosting entity) retains full **data sovereignty** – an important consideration for handling sensitive commercial data (no risk of third-party cloud exposure or license expirations halting research). As one case study noted, a solution built with 100% open-source components avoids vendor lock-in and gives the institution complete control.

This architecture is presented as a blueprint and can be refined further in implementation. The system diagram provided illustrates how the pieces fit together and interact (from user login, through Nextcloud, into the Kubernetes-run services, and storage beneath). Each tool chosen is the result of balancing many options and picking those that best meet the needs of supply chain research collaboration. For example, Nextcloud over other file platforms due to its rich collaboration features, or Kubernetes for orchestration due to its dominance in hybrid cloud management. These choices are justified by the references and reasoning throughout the document.

Technical stakeholders should find that the design leverages proven, community-supported technologies in a novel combination tailored to research, while academic stakeholders can appreciate that the platform’s design inherently upholds the principles of open science and reproducibility. By using this blueprint as a guide, the team can proceed to implementation confident that the end system will be open, powerful, and adaptable – a solid foundation for groundbreaking supply chain analytics and a model for future open science platforms.

**Sources:** The solution integrates insights and best practices from various open-source and research platform documentation, including Nextcloud’s deployment in research contexts, recommendations for reproducible research infrastructures, and modern data platform architectures. All referenced materials underscore the feasibility and strengths of the chosen components in an open environment. The design thus stands on both a strong theoretical foundation and real-world validations from the open-source community.
